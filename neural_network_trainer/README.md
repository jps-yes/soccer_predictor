# Neural network trainer
The neural network was implemented mostly from scratch in Matlab, although some code snippets were used as provided by 
[Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The excel file containing training data, _traning_data.xlxs_ should be added to this directory.

<sup>A lot of these features are overkill for this application where a medium sized dataset was used.

Again this was made for the sake of learning, not necessarily to save time or have the best performance ever.</sup>
