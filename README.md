# Soccer Predictor
<sub>__Disclaimer__: This project is solely an exercise on web scraping and machine learning.
I do not use to place bets myself, but if you are willing to proceed anyways, first consider that past performance
does not guarantee further performance. The further to the future we get, the more the conditions the matches are
played change and the more we are extrapolating from the training dataset. Concretely, new rules might be
introduced to the game, for instance the introduction of the video assistant referee (VAR). External factors can also
negatively influence the performance of the model, for instance COVID-19.</sub>
