<p>Disclaimer: This project is largely an exercise on web scraping and machine learning.
I do not use to place bets myself.
If anyways you decide to place a bet consider that _past performance might not guarantee further performance_.
The further to the future we get, the more the conditions the matches are played change and the more we are
extrapolating from the training dataset. Concretely, new rules might be introduced to the game, for instance the
introduction of the video assistant referee (VAR), and external factors can influence negatively the performance 
of the model, for instance COVID-19.</>
